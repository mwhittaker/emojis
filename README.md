# Emojis

This directory contains a list of all emojis and emoji sequences, along with
their names, groups, and subgroups. The data is parsed from
[emoji-test.txt][emoji-test] from unicode.org.

There are many other emoji datasets:

- https://emojibase.dev/
- https://github.com/muan/emojilib/blob/main/dist/emoji-en-US.json
- https://github.com/github/gemoji/blob/master/db/emoji.json
- https://unpkg.com/emoji.json@14.0.0/emoji.json

This dataset differs in that it only includes fully qualified emoji sequences
but otherwise includes all sequences. Other datasets tend to omit skin tone
variations or include unqualified emojis.
